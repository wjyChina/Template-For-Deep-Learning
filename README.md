# Template-For-Deep-Learning

This project is used for applying deep learning easily and conveniently to cleaned data. All you need to do is adjusting the hyper-parameters, structures and functions for computing accuracy and loss, which would be marked by  ### Change here ###.

These templates are based on PyTorch and Google Colab. Remember to set your notebook setting to GPU first.

For further data loading and deep learning methods, I recommend https://github.com/rasbt/deeplearning-models/tree/master/pytorch_ipynb by Sebastian Raschka.
