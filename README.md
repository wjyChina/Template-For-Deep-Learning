# Template-For-Deep-Learning

This project is used for applying deep learning easily and conveniently to cleaned data. All you need to do is adjusting the hyper-parameters, structures and functions for computing accuracy and loss, which would be marked by  ### Change here ###.

These templates are based on PyTorch and Google Colab. Remember to set your notebook setting to GPU first.
